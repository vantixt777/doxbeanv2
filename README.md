# DoxBean V2 is a powerful Denial-of-Service (DoS) stress testing tool, engineered to push servers to their absolute limits. It's the evolution of the original DoxBean, rebuilt from the ground up with one goal: maximum destructive power.

Its flagship feature, "Apocalypse" mode, unleashes a biblical-scale flood of HTTP requests using advanced multi-threading and a built-in proxy armada to evade basic defenses. This isn't just a testâ€”it's a full-scale assault.

Key Features:

Apocalypse Mode: The most powerful load testing mode available, delivering unparalleled request volume.

Standalone EXE: A compiled executable for easy use and to protect the advanced code from skids and copycats.

Proxy Integration: Automatically utilizes a curated list of proxies to distribute attacks and bypass IP restrictions.

User-Friendly GUI: A dark, intuitive interface built with PyQt for precise control and real-time monitoring.

Integrated Ping Tool: Includes a network-level ping flood utility for additional testing methods.

Disclaimer: This tool is intended for ethical security testing and load analysis of systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal. The user assumes all responsibility.

DoxBean V2 isn't an upgrade. It's the final word.
